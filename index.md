### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was a favorite because it was the first lab that helped me understand how object-oriented classes worked. Using object-oriented classes I was able to go through a vector of states, each of which has data members for the name, population, and land area of the state, and print out the name of the state with the highest and the lowest density. Although the concept of object-oriented classes were hard to understand at first, this lab helped me know how they work.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was a favorite because it taught me how to generate images with the help of the GraphicsMagick library. I was able to make a nice gradient image using code. The image itself is made of 3 different images combined into one. By combining the three, the gradient image is made.

* Lab 09

    Lab 09, part 1 was a favorite because it made me implement a rather complex algorithm into a function. Learning how scores are calculated in Olympic events was interesting. It is always satisfying to figure out how an algorithm works and translate it into code.
